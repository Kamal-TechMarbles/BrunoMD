Bruno MD puts science first with over 25 years of pharmaceutical research and proven clinical studies backing every product we make. At its heart, science yearns to answer questions that better the human condition. How can we improve the outcomes for our customers? Our mother company, Bruno Farmateutici S.p.A, answers those questions for millions of our cardiac, diabetic, and eye patients each year with beneficial pharmacology: molecules that interact with cells and tissues that help save lives.<br><br>\nBruno MD approaches supplements with the same philosophy. We look at health and wellness and ask, “How can nature Herself help improve the human condition?” We answer that question with prescription-grade supplements and a scientific breakthrough called Phytosome® technology. Phytosome® delivers clinically proven nutrients where your body needs them in their most potent form. It’s called Ultra-Bioavailability. Consider this Nature’s prescription for health and wellness. Without Phytosome technology delivering nutrients at the molecular level, you are receiving minimal benefit from ordinary supplements. <b>Bruno MD. Science first<\/b>.",

Certain tissues within the body are no longer reproduced at the required levels. Cartilage tissue wears out, bones become more porous, blood vessels calcify and stiffen. The blood flow decreases, and as a result neither the tissue nor the brain is optimally provided for. The skin loses its ability to store moisture. These aging processes cannot be halted or reversed.

Collagen is the most abundant component in the human body, and therefore the most important component of human connective tissue. This extraordinary protein is also the central building block of the bones, joints, tendons, and many other tissues and structures. Collagen provides a structure for the body and its many organs, and keeps them &ldquo;together&rdquo; in the truest sense of the word. It is present nearly everywhere in the body, forming and connecting moving parts, like the bones, and in turn, the muscles, tendons, and ligaments with the bones.<\/p>"

              "acc_title": "What are collagen peptides?",
              "acc_text": "<p>When we are young, our body is busy day and night performing renovation work. It keeps itself young by breaking down old tissue, while at the same time building new tissue to replace old. As we age, this process slows down, but it never ceases. When our body breaks down collagen, these long chains are disassembled, by enzymes, into small &ldquo;snippets'' for removal. This sends a signal to the body: &ldquo;Attention! Bits of degraded collagen are floating around here; we have to start rebuilding.&rdquo; A young and healthy body reacts promptly to build the required quantity. As we age, our metabolism becomes weary and these signals are no longer enough for the body, which is becoming sluggish. When we consume collagen peptides as a dietary supplement, we ingest just these collagen snippets, but in larger amounts. Our bodies are rapidly digesting and absorbing collagen, mainly in the form of the smallest units, single amino acids, but also partially in intact form as collagen peptides (collagen snippets). These collagen snippets reach the bloodstream and distribute throughout the body. Now the cells in our body, which are responsible for connective tissue\/collagen metabolism, notice that there is an imbalance. It is like an alarm, &ldquo;Attention! There are lots of collagen particles swimming about here, now we really have to get work and make even more collagen!&rdquo; As the collagen supplements provide the amino acids, building blocks for collagen synthesis at the same time, they support the body twofold. In this way, collagen peptides stimulate our body&rsquo;s own collagen production. The whole connective tissue metabolism comes to life. Taking the skin as an example, it can be shown that other important components of skin structure, such as elastin and proteoglycans, are also produced in great quantities. The dermis, the second layer of skin, is, so to speak, completely overhauled. At the same time the degradation of the skin is slowed. In total, more collagen is being built up than broken down, and it is exactly this effect that many users, mostly women, describe as a more attractive, firmer, radiant complexion. The balance also shifts in other tissue types such as cartilage or bone: increased formation, slower degradation. This also explains why dietary supplements cannot produce visible or tangible results instantly disappear. Our body needs time to adapt to these processes. It is important to note one thing, collagen peptides do not only affect the symptoms, but also address the causes of the problems directly.<\/p>"

Here&rsquo;s how:&nbsp; the blood vessels that supply nutrients to your roots are made of collagen. In other words, improved microcirculation from our specific collagen peptides helps increase hair vitality and strength by growing healthier hair from the roots up! Hair grows faster and more robust with renewed luster and bounce.<\/p>",

Our technology tells your collagen cells, &ldquo;Hey! We&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; low here!&rdquo; which in turn stimulates these cells to pump out new collagen no matter your levels.
